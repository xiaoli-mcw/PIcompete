Description: This package fits competing risks models to failure time (or survival time) data for two competing events. Failure time for one event of the competing events can be prevalent left-censored, interval-censored or a mixture of truly incident disease and missed prevalent disease when disease ascertainment is not always conducted at baseline, while failure time for the other event is only interval-censored. Baseline is set to be time 0. This package also provides the option for handling stratafied random samples with different probability sampling fractions across strata.
