\item{Data}{Data used to fit the model containing columns for each term in p.model, i.model1 and i.model2 expressions.
For stratified random sampling designs, columns denoted samp.wgt and strata are expected indicating the sampling weights and sampling strata.
population="super" option, an additional column denoted strata.frac is expected indicating the fraction of the population
that consists of each strata.  For example, if in the target population there are three strata that occurs with proportions 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6,
then strata.frac will take values of 0.2, 0.4 or 0.6.}

\item{p.model}{The prevalence model for event 1 to be fitted, specified using an expression of the form \emph{C~model}.
Elements in the expression are as followed:
\itemize{
\item c - Numeric variable indicating whether the event was prevalent at time zero, taking values of 1="Yes", 0="No", -999="Unknown";
\item model - Linear predictor consisting of a series of terms separated by \emph{+} operators.

\itemize{
\item C - Numeric variable indicating whether the event was prevalent at time zero, taking values of 1="Yes", 0="No", -999="Unknown";

\item{time.list}{a vector of finite time points at which subdistribution hazard functions are estimated. Default to NULL. For example, when an irregular spaced time points are of interest, time.list=c(1,3,8,10).}

\description{
This package fits competing risks models to failure time (or survival time) data for two competing events. 
Failure time for one event of the competing events can be prevalent left-censored, interval-censored or a mixture 
of truly incident disease and missed prevalent disease when disease ascertainment is not always conducted at baseline, 
while failure time for the other event is only interval-censored. Baseline is set to be time 0. 
General transformation,G(x)=(1+r*x)/r if r>0; =x if r=0, is used for a subdistribution hazard function multiplied by an exponential effect of a linear combination of risk factors  
for flexible incidence models. Logistic regression models are used for prevalence. The IPW log-likelihood approach, which uses the inverse of sample inclusion probabilities,
is employed to account for different sampling fractions across strata.
